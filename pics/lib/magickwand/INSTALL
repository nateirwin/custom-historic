MagickWand Extension for PHP :: Installation Instructions

** REQUIRED **  ImageMagick version :: 6.1.8-4
Last-known-good ImageMagick version :: 6.1.8-4


Installation Steps

1) Either install the required ImageMagick version or make sure that it
   is installed (running "Wand-config --version" should give you the
   required information).

2) Extract the contents of the archive this file was in, or copy the
   entire directory the this file is in (make sure that it is still called
   "magickwand") to the "ext" directory in the PHP source folder. So, if
   your PHP source folder is called "PHP_SRC_DIR", you should end up with
   a directory structure like the following:

   PHP_SRC_DIR/ext/magickwand/

3) Go into the "PHP_SRC_DIR/ext/magickwand/" directory, and run "phpize".
   (A note: if this is the first time PHP is being installed, you have to
   install PHP without MagickWand, because "phpize" is a part of the PHP
   distribution.)

4) Go back to the main PHP source directory (from the example above, it
   would be "PHP_SRC_DIR", and run:

   rm ./configure

   and then

   ./buildconf --force

   to remove and rebuild the PHP configure script.

5) Follow the PHP installation instructions, but add

   --with-magickwand=IMG_MGCK_DIR
   
   to your ./configure command, replacing "IMG_MGCK_DIR" with the full path
   of the directory where ImageMagick is installed (in most cases "/usr").
