Modules are the code segments that can be shared among multiple pages.
The directory templates/modules contains only the html code for the modules
The directory lib/modules		contains the php code for the modules

Some modules may not have any php code behind them such as login module. The segments of 
code, which do NOT require any html code but is used by more than one page are not considered a module. 
And they probably are under lib/commServs directory such as session management.

Template modules 

-- login
module which shows the login box

-- greetings
module which prints Welcome {$user} code
